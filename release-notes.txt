Latest:
1/19/19 - 14 HOTFIX and Setting revamp
              - (HOTFIX) fixed =menu error in file push workaround
              - completely reworked how suroadb saves and reads data and preferences, now relies on a
              single file to be called to change settings!
              - added more logging commands to runtime
              - minor adjustments and improvements to runtime
              - removed custom directory changer as it's obsolete
              - completely broke the defaults manager in settings (kek)

              I have reworked how SuroADB saves and reads data to reduce clutter for it's data folders. Be wary though, as this
              change was rushed. Bugs and nasty crashes might happen.. If you do encounter any, please
              open an issue discussion at https://github.com/nicamoq/SuroADB/issues/new
              
              The defaults manager (that neat default setting organizer) (yes, that one) is unusable at the moment. Sorry!
              
              



1/3/19 - 13.1 2019!
              - added a workaround for file push filename error!
               |- can detect if file has spaces
               |- switches to workaround that copies the folder (Push) containing the file to directory of your choosing
              - updated and improved sroadbupdate.exe old version detection
              - updated sroadbupdateui.bat to display more lines
              - minor adjustments for settings and screenrecord ui
              - fixed and improved error logging
              
              This update was ready for release in the last week of December, but due to some busy schedules and christmas
              celebrations, I wasn't able to! I'm sorry for the huge delay.
              
              I have added a new failsafe mechanism with the file push operations which can detect if a file has spaces, when
              it does detect spaces or a filename error, it will switch to a workaround.
              
              Happy New Year!
              
11/28/18 - 13 December!
              - added options for runtime (startup) in settings
               • configure what command SuroADB starts after startup
               • option to disable adb devices check to improve startup speed
               • option to delete runtime logs after exit (via exit command)
              - fixed a minor ui mistake for file pull
              - minor improvements to file push ui
              - minor ui tweaks for settings
              - reverted platform-tools to that of SuroADB 11.1 due to compatibility issues like getting stuck in mid-pull operation
                and mismatching adb server
              - removed some adb dependencies as they're not dependencies at all, this also improves startup speed

              It's been almost 3 weeks since the last release. But i've been continously updating and releasing
              BETA SuroADB versions. This beta program for SuroADB makes my worktime limits and bug fixes work together
              and reduce my own workload, and i'm damn glad that I made it this way!
              
              The next release may be released late next month, but BETA updates will come early.
              
              Advanced merry christmas, everybody! 

11/4/18 - 12.1 End of sembreak
              - now hosted on GitHub!
              - added support for BETA version fetching
               • SuroADB can automatically start and use the latest BETA version automatically
              - changed all update checking servers to GitHub
              - fixed APK install menu unable to go back to main bug
              - fixed "cols" and "color" on normal and menu color scheme changer's ui
              - fixed a minor text interface mistake in uninstall
              - some more stuff that i forgot to note out
              
              Ah, it's finally the beggining of the Second Semester.
              
              SuroADB is now hosted on GitHub, which is faster and easier! I was not able to update much of the actual
              ADB scripts because I focused on support for easier updates.
              
              
              The new BETA version fetching works like this:
              
              You download 12.1 >> You will get notified if a work-in-progress version of v13.0 is out ex. 13A >> If you choose to
              download the new version, the fetcher UI will automatically set SuroADB to start the new version >> fetcher UI will
              grab SuroADB 13.0BETA Build 13A from GitHub which is only 400kb >> Once done downloading, SuroADB will now start that
              version when you start the original version you were using (12.1)
              
              So basically starting SuroADB 12.1 will now redirect you to SuroADB 13.0 BETA Build 13A at startup if you chose to
              download the aforementioned BETA version.
              
              Pretty complicated? Yeah, I know. I spent hours making the script for this.
              
              
              See you!
              
10/28/18 - 12 SEMMMMMMBREAAAAAAAK
              - Added titles for commands on runtime (so you will know what's currently going on)
              - Minor bug fixes and improvements to runtime
              - Removed some adb install features as they are unstable
              - Reworked color scheme setter:
               • now works faster and does not need a full restart of SuroADB
               • also improved it's error identification
              - UI adjustments and improvements:
               • apk install and other commands' ui fixed to their menus after execution (it used to go back to MAIN menu)
               • added some dialogue for apk install such as Copying to "%wdre%\sroadbtemp\SuroADB" ...
               • improved screenshot and screenrecord ui functions
               • added cls function after every input (so you won't get an awkward delay feel)
              - Probably fixed more stuff but forgot to note them

              It's currently sem break here in the Philippines, I'm so sorry I was not able to update SuroADB! As the second semester
              was fast approaching, of course our teachers for the first semester gave us a TON of things to do, which left us students
              very busy. I was quite busy but I was still able to upload BETA versions of SuroADB which are readily available but very
              unstable.

              I hope this second sem will go easy on me.. as I can't set my priorities straight.


10/8/18 - 11.1 Stability fixes
              - Fixed a flaw for the file push error detection
              - Improved the UI for WiFi mode setter
              - Fixed a few bugs for WiFi mode setter
              - Added some minor performance improvements
              - Minor improvements to update checker

              See you in the next update!


9/29/18 - 11 The most "stable" release yet! -NOPE
              - Added the "Compact" menu UI mode
              - Added ADB wifi debugging support
              - Added an external comparing database (for error corrections)
              - Finally updated the help menu
              - Improved path config features
              - Improved inputs
              - Improved some UI elements
              - Fixed and improved the Uninstall feature
              - A LOT of bug fixes and improvements (lost count!)
              - And some others I forgot I added

              It's been two whole weeks since I released the heavily bugged SuroADB 10.1. I sincerely apologized for the delay!

              I have been very busy with school work lately. I was working in and out of my laptop due to my laziness and busy
              schedules, thus I was not really able to decide what to do next.. should I release this mess for my angry users or should
              I wait until i'm less busy (another 1 week), then finish it?? Well I obviously chose option 2.

              To be honest, I think my decision was very much for the best. I was able to make some swift fixes a few hours ago
              and made ((code audits)) to be sure that there's no remaining bugs (which will be discovered later anyway :P).

              Okay enough personal stuff, this update brings a new feature- WIFI mode! Now you can set SuroADB to automatically start
              ADB to connect with your device via the same hotspot your computer and device are in so you won't rely on a cable much.

              Please report bugs at suroadb.jimdoree.com/contact/ it's highly appreciated!

9/14/18 - 10.1 One step for Background Threading
              - Improved Update checking by making it a Background Thread so SuroADB can start faster
              - Improved logging (Error logging, Session logging, Logging altogether)
              - Added more error handling countermeasures
              - Added logging for Update checking
              - Added the Uninstall option (unstable)
              - Minor UI tweaks
              - Bug fixes

              
              I have made the Update Check feature completely background threaded so SuroADB will start waaaay faster. The slow start
              was an issue caused by the download script if the user has slow internet. This new and improved update checker will
              run in the background until it successfully downloads or fails updatechk.bat. A popup prompt will show when an update
              is available while you use SuroADB (and it's so goddamn satisfying!).
              
              I will experiment with off-window processes for a while, and I might add them in SuroADB's file Push and Pull
              features soon to support Multi-tasking.
              
9/8/18 - 10 Long break
              - Added more ADB features for APK install, (install to sdcard, replace existing app, etc)
              - Added UI for update feature in suroadb settings
              - Added directory configuration for Internal and External storage and added a UI for it (Currently has no use)
              - Added the debug test (creates debug report for troubleshooting)
              - Removed file push command "Copy to a folder named SuroADB" flawed feature (now it copies to the path you enter instead)
              - Removed "cls" from file and folder pull command to prevent sudden clearing of screen
              - Various fixes for file push
              - Slightly minor changes to logs
              - Log file generation improvements
              - Tweaked the UI
              - Fixed various scripts and minor bugs
              - New material icon

              Sorry for the wait! I was quite busy with school stuff these past few weeks and i didn't have enough time and energy to 
              finish the update quite soon, but here it is!

              I was planning to release it last Sunday but it was unfinished and was riddled with bugs. I just made the scripts for the 
              updated adb features, removed file push to suroadb, and some other fixes and improvements just a few hours ago. By the 
              way, it's 12:19 AM and i'm very sleepy. Well, enjoy the new update!

8/19/18 - 9.1 Hotfix and more error handling
              - HOTFIX: Uninstall command exiting randomly bug fixed
              - Revamped file copy and apk install to detect errors
              - Added error dialogs for Install and Push
              - Added "exit /b" commands for automatic restore scripts (so they don't stay in processes)
              - Added loading bar for update check at startup, same goes for the settings version
              - Added a 1 second pause for automatic restore script creation (the os can't keep up with cmd sometimes)
              - Improved the Update Check feature
              - Removed "failed to fetch updatechk.bat" error
              - Tweaked the UI and fixed various code errors


              For the install command, after selecting an apk, it will copy to SuroADB's temp folder, then it will be renamed to
              a random string (ex. 6969.apk). This is because ADB can't handle filenames with spaces/long characters. It's also
              an added error handler! If windows cannot copy the file due to filename error, SuroADB will detect this and prompt
              you to rename the apk. This is the same mechanism for the file Push command.

8/15/18 - 9.0 Bugfixes
              - Fixed the custom directory feature (it resets after start)
              - Revamped how files are copied to device (the selected file will be copied to a temp folder, then copied to device)
              - Added option to opt out of update checking via First Run screen
              - Some other minor adjustments for the UI and code

8/5/18 8.1 FINAL Update

              - SuroADB will now check for updates in each start (you can disable it by adding updtstop.txt to the TEMP folder)
                • You can do this in SuroADB by entering adb custom mode, then enter "echo > updtstop.txt" without quotes.
              - Fixed a few command errors, slightly improved error handling
              - Fixed typos in dialogues
              - Removed a few unnecessary lines of code that were kept before 7.1

              Source code will now be released as a snippet get-go rather than a full complicated copy-paste from the original
              program itself. This is due to the complicated process of needing to convert it first before it can be used.


I am thinking of retiring from updating SuroADB due to busy schedules and other personal interests ( also due to a lack of audience and users D: )

Bit ironic that i  implement the update check feature right after deciding to retire development.. (heh) (its for bug fixes anyway)


Anyways, if you're using SuroADB, thank you! You're the one that kept me going.

7/29/18 8.0 Bug fixes, Reworked logging

              - HOTFIX: Packages command starts the Pull command error fixed
              - Improved the packages command with a new feature
                Feature:
                • Option to export all package names into a text file
              - Fixed a few bugs
              - Improved error handling, error logs will now be exported to "sroadb-errorlog.txt"
              - Improved and reworked logging, logs will now be exported to "sroadb-logs.txt"

              Logging has been reworked to export in a single text file along with the time and date, so it's easier to read
              and won't look like a mess.

              Thank you!



7/22/18 7.1  Sleepless REVAMP - SuroADB is now standalone-only

              - Added adb shell mode
              - Replaced the old "suroadb" to; and added the SuroADB Settings menu
              - Moved the Interface feature to SuroADB Settings and renamed it to "col"
              - Added logging again, but this time, you have the option to turn it on and off
              - Implemented automatic-restore scripts that will apply at start

                Features that have this:
                • Custom working directory
                • Logging switch (yes/no)
                • Color scheme
                • Screen recording size
                • Screen recording time
                • Screen recording save path
                • Screenshot save path

              - Improved various features (primarily screenshot and screenrecord)
              - Revamped improvements for error handling


              Note: SuroADB uses a Windows temp folder as a working directory by default.
                    SuroADB will not work if executed outside the HOME drive. (usually C:)


              Starting now, SuroADB will be released as Standalone only. New and old features have been revamped and designed to
              work with SuroADB's Temp folder. I have made this decision due to my own interests and due to my busy schedules affecting
              how i work on it.

              If you're reading this, thank you for taking the time to use SuroADB. I really appreciate it.

Warning: SuroADB.exe has a tendency to freeze if you directly close it with the traditional way to
              close application, You may need to close suroadb with the EXIT command
              or use the included force-close.bat file.
